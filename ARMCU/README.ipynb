    "# ARMCU: ARM Cumulus case - 21 June 1997\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The case referred to as **ARMCU** focuses on the diurnal cycle of shallow cumulus over land. It is based on an idealisation of the measurements at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site made on 21 June 1997. It has been used in the large‐eddy simulation intercomparison study of Brown et al. (2002) and in the single column model intercomparison study of Lenderink et al. (2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The case setup follows the description of Brown et al. (2002), completed by http://projects.knmi.nl/eurocs/ARM/case_ARM_html/\n",
    "\n",
    "### General specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The case starts on 21 June 1997, 11:30 UTC (05:30 LT), and finish on 22 June 1997, 02:00 UTC (21 June 1997, 20:00 LT). The latitude is 36°N and the longitude is 97.48°W. The altitude above the geoide is about ?? m, and the surface pressure is set to 970 hPa and is supposed to remain constant along the case.,\n",

    "<a name=\"footnote1\">1</a>: Note that, in contrary to what is documented at http://projects.knmi.nl/eurocs/ARM/case_ARM_html/, Brown et al. (2002) indicates that the large-scale forcing should decrease linearly to zero between 1000 m and 2000 m, so that no forcing is applied for $z$ > 2000 m (instead of 3000 m here). It seems that a correction has been applied to the original specification."
