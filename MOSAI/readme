===============

REF/ contains the generic drivers (python scripts)

input_files/ contains the netCDF files with the soundings

forcing_files/ contains 
- the ascii files with the surface forcings for different covers (MAIZE, DECIDUOUS)
- the netCDF files with the atmospheric tendencies from ARPEGE oper simulations

Each other repertory contains a bash script that copies the inputs and forcing
files and runs the REF/driver* scripts with command line argument corresponding
to the setting of the repo. The available command line arguments can be listed
with
$ cd REF/
$ python driver_DEF.py -h

usage: driver_DEF.py [-h] -c cover [-n name_config] [-s thresh_sensib] [-a]

options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -c cover          cover type: MAIZE|DECIDUOUS
  -n name_config    name of subcase variant
  -s thresh_sensib  sensible heat flux threshold
  -a                flag to activate advection tendencies

to create a new subcase,
copy one of the existing subcases (e.g. MAIZE/) and adapt make_cas.sh
