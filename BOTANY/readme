===============

REF/ contains the generic drivers (python scripts)
SHORT/ same but just the first day

input_files/ contains the txt files with the initial profiles and tendencies

make_cases.sh [configure "sim" parameter inside the script]
  makes RUN-XXX repos with corresponding inputs and forcings and runs
  $sim/driver_DEF.py

To create a new subcase:
- case initialization or forcings: add profiles_member_XXX.txt in input_files/
- model configuration: copy REF/ to new repo and adapt driver_DEF.py
