===============

REF/ contains the generic drivers (python scripts)

input_files/ contains the txt files with the initial profiles and tendencies

Each other repertory contains a bash script that copies the inputs and forcing
files and runs the REF/driver* scripts with command line argument corresponding
to the setting of the repo. The available command line arguments can be listed
with
$ cd REF/
$ python driver_DEF.py -h

To create a new subcase,
copy one of the existing subcases (e.g. RUN006/) and adapt make_cas.sh
