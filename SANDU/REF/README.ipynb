    "# SANDU composite case - REF version - 15-18 July 2006\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The case referred to as **SANDU/REF** ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The case setup is described in Sandu and Stevens (2011). It was also used in the LES intercomparison of de Roode et al. (2016). The full documentation of the case is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GdR-DEPHY/DEPHY-SCM/master/SANDU/description_composite.pdf), with an addendum [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GdR-DEPHY/DEPHY-SCM/master/SANDU/description_composite_addendum.txt) (relaxation of wind, temperature and humidity). Besides we use the input file composite_ref_init.nc downloaded at http://gop.meteo.uni-koeln.de/~neggers/transitions/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The case starts on 15 July 2006<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup>, 18:00 UTC (10:00 LT), lasts 72 hours and finish on 18 July 2006, 18:00 UTC. The latitude is 25°N and the longitude is 125°W. The surface pressure is set to 1016.811 hPa and is supposed to remain constant along the case.\n",

    "### Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is originally defined in terms of liquid potential temperature $\\theta_l$ and total water content $q_t$. The initial profiles are idealized between the surface and 3200 m:\n",

    " 4.12 - 0.37 \\times 10^{-3} \\times (z-945.54) & \\text{if } 945.54 \\leq z \\leq 3200 \\text{ m}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear interpolation is used at the inversion between 902.52 and 945.54 m.\n",
    "The wind reads for $0 \\leq z \\leq 3200$ m:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "u(z) & = & -2.25\\\\\n",
    "v(z) & = & -5.69+1.44\\times 10^{-3} \\times z\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiles were then vertically extended with ERA-Interim up to 47973.81 m.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * The vertical grid has 10-m resolution for all fields, from the surface to 47970 m. The time axis goes from 18:00 UTC, 15 July 2006 to 18:00 UTC, 15 July 2006 with a 30-minute timestep. All conversion assume no liquid water ($q_l=0$, so that $q_v=q_t$ and $r_v=r_t$. This is definitely something to improve in the future.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Pressure is computed using the altitude, the liquid potential temperature ($\\theta=\\theta_l$ and surface pressure, assuming a dry atmosphere;\n",
    "  * $q_t$ is assumed to be equal to $q_v$ (no liquid water);\n",
    "  * $r_t$ is computed from $q_t$ and $r_v$ is assumed to be equal to $r_t$ (also no liquid water);\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Add cloud droplet concentration\n",
    "  * Improve calculation of the pressure from z, T, qv...\n",
    "  * Convert $\\theta_l,q_t$ to $\\theta,q_v,q_l$ or $T,q_v,q_l$ \n",
    "  * Extrapolation above 50 km ??\n",
    "  * No conversion of ozone mixing ratio to specific mass is yet performed.\n",

    "<b id=\"f1\">1</b>: The original definition does not provide any year. The transition composite was performed over 2006 and 2007 and therefore 2006 is chosen. The only expected impact is through the change in solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere and should be minor.[↩](#a1)\n",
